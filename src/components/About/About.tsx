					<p>
					  Thank you for visiting my website, I am Jaime Eduardo S. Kafati, I’ve been painting since my arrival to the United States in 1978, but it was until 2018, when I retired from my day-job that I was able to enjoy my studio on a fulltime basis. Between intermittent commissioned works, I involved myself in continued figurative studies, attending local life-drawing sessions, exploring new mediums, and executing allegorical paintings that allow me to express my personal contemplations of the world.
					</p>
					<p>
					  Although oils are my primary medium, I love to experiment with a diverse set of mediums and styles. While my works are continually evolving in style and subject matter, the characters within my figurative works reflect a global community, as the human form occupies the central motif of most of my paintings, and within the figure, I give a voice to our humanity.
					</p>
					<p>
					  My works are in private and public collections, through the years my works have been exhibited at statewide events. In 2021 and 2022, I was tremendously humbled when several of my works were selected within the national and international stage. Listed below some of the notable events within my artist life:
